  The libsvm license ("the modified BSD license") is compatible with many free
  software licenses such as GPL. Hence, it is very easy to use libsvm in your
  software. It can also be used in commercial products.

  The contained MD5 and Murmor hashing functions were integrated from
  public sources. Their respective copyrights follow:
  .
  MD5
  .
  This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
  The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
  written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
  This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
  .
  Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
  This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
  except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
  with every copy.
  .
  To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
  MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
  needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
  will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
  .
  MurmurHash2

  .
  Note - This code makes a few assumptions about how your machine behaves -
  .
  1. We can read a 4-byte value from any address without crashing
  2. It will not produce the same results on little-endian and big-endian
     machines.
